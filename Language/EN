10#How to enter a word into a deck:\n\nIn the database, each line is reserved for one word. Everytime you use the ""OK"" button, the program uses 1 line.Here's how you should enter words with some examples;\n\nIn short:\n--Noun--\nN, Article, Singular Word, Plural Word, Main Meaning, Other Meaning1, Other Meaning2, ...\n\nE.x.: N, der, Boden, Böden, ground, floor, bottom, base, land, soild, ground floor,\n\n--Verb--\nNormal Verb: V, Verb, NV, Main Meaning, Other Meaning1, Other Meaning2, ...\nSeperable Verb: V, Verb, TV, Main Meaning, Other Meaning1, Other Meaning2, ...\n\nE.x.;\nNormal Verb: \nV, blicken, NV, to glance, to look, to gaze\nV, an etw.(Dat.) kleben, NV, to be glued to sth., to cleave to sth., to adhere to sth.\n\nSeperable Verb: \nV, umkreisen, TV, to orbit, to revolve, to circuit\n\n--Adjective--\nA, Adjective, Main Meaning, Other Meaning1, Other Meaning2,... \n\nExplanation for some nitpicks:\nYou might recognize that every line starts with either 'V' or 'N' or 'A'.This is for the program to understand what kind of word it is.\n\nAlso, in verb types there are two types of verbs. 'NV' and 'TV'.These are also for the program to use. 'NV' stands for "Normal Verb" and 'TV' stands for "Trennbare Verb".This feature doesn't have any use right now, but it will be in the future.\n\nShortcuts:\n*When you press 'Enter' the program automatically adds a comma and a space at the end of your text.

If you were wrong, click \"Wrong\". If you didn't have had any guess, then click \"Passed\".\n\nIf you were not able to guess the \'main meaning\' but one of the other meanings of the word, then you should click \"Half Point\".\n\nYour grade is calculated in accordance with the following:\nRight-> + 1P\nWrong-> - 1P\nHalf Point-> 0,5P\nPassed-> 0P
